RateMaking Process
-estimation of premium for a future policy period
-begins with historical premium
-applies with a series of adjustments

Overall rate level indication
-to evaluate whether the rates underlying the company's premium adequately cover expected losses, 
 expenses and target underwriting profit
-two general approaches
-Pure premium approach
-Loss ratio approach(Require the estimation of premium to be collected during the future time period)

Premium Aggregation 
-method 1: calendar year/accident year
-method 2: policy year

Policy year: if you have a year, you focus on the policies written in that year, it is DEVELOPING[Usually you will see AS OF]
Calandar year: if you have a year, you are focusing on the money accrued on that time inserval, it is STATIC

Written/Earned/In-Force

In-Force premium
-a snapshot
-sum of FULL TERM preimum of all effective policy at a certain point of time

Good example to tell the difference of calandar year and policy year!!
Why written premium is different for policy year and calandar year?
-consider a cancellation
-Calandar year: may booked to two canlandar year
-policy year: will be book to that year

What is the difference between earned premium and written premium for policy year?
-both are not closed at the end of period


Adjustment of premium
-Current rate level adjustment(on level): Extension of exposures vs. Parallelogram method
-Development to Ultimate(premium trend): One-step trending vs. two-step trending

Extension of Exposures
-rerate every historical policy based on today's manual(rating level)

Parallelogram Method
-adjust the aggregated historical premium by an average factor to put the premium on-level
-1.divide policy into levels by rate change, and calculate a cummulative rate level index[a stat to reflect the relative rate level between groups)
-2.for a particuar calandar year, calculate the weight of earned premium contributed by each rate level group
-3.for that calandar year, calculate averge rate level index
-4.on level factor for that period=current cumulative rate level index/average rate level index for historical period
