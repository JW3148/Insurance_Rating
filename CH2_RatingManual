-Territory
-protection level, construction type
-underwriting tier

-Miscellaneous Credit: e.g. new home discount, 5-year claims-free discount, multi-policy discount
-Additional optional coverage

high risk workspace)

Important! Check if the ALAE is part of the limit, ALAE can be huge(e.g. defense costs)

Claims-made coverage vs. Occurence coverage
- the coverage trigger is the data the claim is reported, rather than the data the event occurs
- for example, a event occurs in the policy period but reported after the period will not the be covered
- it is the time when a event is reported matters, 
- should be cheaper than occurence coverage
