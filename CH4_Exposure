Exposure(it is a unit which used to measure risk, like km is used to measure distance, F is used measure temperature)
- basic unit that measures a policy's exposure to loss
- serve as the basis for the calculation of premium
- base rate is typically expressed as rate per exposure(like Gas, which are priced per Gallon, 2$/Gallon)

Premium=base rate X No. of exposure X (adjustmetnt by rating variables and fees)
Gas fill cost at a station= rate($/gallon) X No. of gallon you fill

Good Exposure base
-should be directly proportion to expection loss
-should be practical
-should consider pre-existing base in the industry(think about the fact that you may difficult to use km to replace mile in US, because
people are getting used to miles and it has become a standard

Directly proportion to expection loss
-ideally, a policy with two exposure should expect twice the loss compared to a similar policy with only one exposure
-The factor with the most direct relationship to the losses should be selected as the exposure base
-for example, a home insured for two years should expect twice the loss compared to same home insured for one year, other variable fixed
-for example, a home valued at 200000 has a bigger expect loss than one valued at 100000, but may not be as high as 2 times
-in this case, we can say home year is a better base than home value
