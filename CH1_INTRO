Exposure
-basic unit of risk(that underlies the insurance premium)
-e.g. one house insured for one year(one exposure for homeowner insurance)
-e.g. annual payroll(U.S. Workers compensation insurance)
-written, earned, unearned, and in-force(means the number of insured units that are exposed to loss)

Premium
-written, earned, unearned, and in-force

Claim
-Incurred but not reported(IBNR) claims: as its name suggests..

Loss
-Paid Losses
-Case Reserve: an estimate of the amount of money required to cover the ultimate settle for that reported claim; it excludes any paid amount
-Reported Losses(or case incurred loss)= Paid Losses + CaseReserve
-Note that reported loss are for known claim, i.e. reported
-Ultimate loss: the amount of money required to settle all claims for a defined group of policy
-Estimated Ultimate Losses = Reported Losses(known claims) + IBNR reserve(not reported) + IBNER Reserve(develpment on know claims)

For a group of policy, at a point of time, some claims are filed, the loss already paid out so far is called paid loss; the estimated 
remaining loss have to be paid on those reported claims is called case reserve; as you can see, paid losses and case reserve are defined on 
reported claims, i.e for known claims, how much i've paid, how much i need to cover the ultimate settlement for these claims. 

At any point of time, an insurer will need to prepare enough reserve to pay claims. it need to consider a) for current reported claim, how much
payment still remaining until final settled? (case reserve); b)so far, there must be some loss already happened but just not reported, how to 
estimate it?(IBNR).

Estimation on loss already happened(incl. reported loss, and not reported)
