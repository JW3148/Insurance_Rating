Exposure
-basic unit of risk(that underlies the insurance premium)
-e.g. one house insured for one year(one exposure for homeowner insurance)
-e.g. annual payroll(U.S. Workers compensation insurance)
-written, earned, unearned, and in-force(means the number of insured units that are exposed to loss)

Premium
-written, earned, unearned, and in-force

Claim
-Incurred but not reported(IBNR) claims: as its name suggests..

Loss
-Paid Losses
-Case Reserve: an estimate of the amount of money required to cover the ultimate settle for that reported claim; it excludes any paid amount
-Reported Losses(or case incurred loss)= Paid Losses + CaseReserve
-Note that reported loss are for known claim, i.e. reported
-Ultimate loss: the amount of money required to settle all claims for a defined group of policy
-Estimated Ultimate Losses = Reported Losses(known claims) + IBNR reserve(not reported) + IBNER Reserve(develpment on know claims)

For a group of policy, at a point of time, some claims are filed, the loss already paid out so far is called paid loss; the estimated 
remaining loss have to be paid on those reported claims is called case reserve; as you can see, paid losses and case reserve are defined on 
reported claims, i.e for known claims, how much i've paid, how much i need to cover the ultimate settlement for these claims. 

At any point of time, an insurer will need to prepare enough reserve to pay claims. it need to consider a) for current reported claim, how much
payment still remaining until final settled? (case reserve); b)so far, there must be some loss already happened but just not reported, how to 
estimate it?(IBNR).

Estimation on loss already happened(incl. reported loss, and not reported) at a point of time.

Loss Adjustment Expense(LAE)/Claim-related expense
-the expense to settle down a claim/loss(excluding the claim itself)
-Allocated(ALAE): the expense that can be associated with that specific claim(e.g. legal fees to defend a claim)
-Unallocated(ULAE): the expense that can't not be assign to a specific claim(e.g. salary of claim department personel)
-LAE = ALAE + ULAE

Underwriting Expenses
-Commission and brokerage
-Other acquisition(e.g. advertisement, marketing)
-General(e.g. maintaining a home office)
-Taxes, licenses, and fees(excluding federal income)

Underwriting Profit
-two main sources
-underwriting profit: or operating income, the sum of profit generated by policies
-investment income

Fundamental insurance equation
- Premium = Losses + LAE + UW Expenses + UW Profit
- key point: Prospective, Balance should be at both aggregate and individule levels

Frequency(of claims)= Number of reported claims/Number of earned exposures
-average claims per exposure

Severity(average claim cost)= Losses/ Number of Claims
- a measure of average cost of claims
- paid severity
- reported severity

Pure Premium(lost cost, cost per exposure)=  Losses / Number of exposure = Severity  x  Frequency

premiums are mostly calculated at exposure level

Average Premium(premium per exposure)= Premium/ Number of exposure

Loss Ratio = Losses/Premium=pure premium/average premium
- the portion of each premium dollar used to pay losses

LAE ratio = Loss Adjustment Expense/ Losses

Loss and LAE ratio= (Loss Adjustment Expense + losses)/premium=loss ratio X (1+ LAE ratio)
- the portion of each premium dollar used to pay losses and LAE

Underwriting Expense Ratio = UW Expense/ Premium
- the portion of each premium dollor used to pay UW expense
- expenses incurred on issueing the policy(e.g. commssion) vs. expense incurred throught the policy(General Expense)
- former are mesure to written preimum, latter are measured as a ratio of earned premium

Operating expense ratio(OER)=UW Expense ratio + LAE/Earned Premium

Retention Ratio = Number of Policies Renowed/ Number of Potential Renewal Policies

Close Ratio(hit ratio, quote-to-close ratio, conversion rate) = Number of Accepted Quotes/Number of Quotes
